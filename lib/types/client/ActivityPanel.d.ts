/**
 * AgentTeams activity panel: the top-right floater monitoring every team.
 *
 * Modeled on the Claude Code desktop SessionActivityPanel: a shell-overlay
 * panel that docks at the conversation's top-right edge by default, can be
 * dragged into a floating window, resized, and folded into an activity badge.
 * On wide viewports the docked panel makes the conversation column yield
 * space; narrow viewports keep a simple inset overlay. It
 * polls the host `/plugins/dsh-agent-teams/state` route for
 * server-side snapshots (durable files + live subagent activity), with a
 * collapsed badge that auto-expands once when activity appears. Archived
 * teams stay available for the owning conversation after live work ends.
 *
 * The floater mounts in ui-layout's additive `shell.overlay`; it is not a
 * conversation node — the in-conversation panel was removed in favor of this
 * always-available monitor.
 * @module dsh-agent-teams/client/activity
