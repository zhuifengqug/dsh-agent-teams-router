/**
 * Event-driven shared task scheduler.

 * idle edge and every task-graph mutation attempts one atomic claim and wakes
 * the selected durable member. A resident member that becomes idle while it
 * still owns an open attempt is parked: only an explicit captain reassignment
 * may rotate that capability. Automatic retry is reserved for cold recovery,
 * when this process has not observed the durable owner settle its open attempt.

Then send_message to captain with source_task_id and source_attempt_id and become idle.
When finishing: use status=completed only when the task's success criteria are satisfied; use status=failed when blocking findings or validation failures mean downstream work must not proceed; include a concise output in either case. Quality kinds must submit structured fields: review/requirements need verdict=pass to complete (needs_revision/reject must fail with findings); implementation/repair/verification/integration need acceptanceResults and commandsRun, while implementation/repair also need in-scope changedPaths. Use status values "passed" or "failed" inside those arrays. After the work and verification finish, call agent_teams_update_task immediately; do not wait for captain confirmation and do not continue exploring. Do not approve your own implementation. Mail is not a formal next review. Completed work must not be repeated to attach late evidence: call update_task on the original task with its attempt_id and acceptanceResults/commandsRun/evidence_note; supplements are append-only and cannot change its verdict. Treat the dependency results above as source material. Do not ignore them. Work only this task and only its in-scope paths in this turn.
